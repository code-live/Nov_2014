Let's implement a jqm application that will use Rotten Tomatoes API.
Rotten Tomatoes is a movie site that hosts information and reviews about hollywood movies.
You can search any movie using this URL, where you replace the MOVIENAME with values like say, Titanic, Transformers etc.,

http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies.json?apikey=edpyxhran22urr7g7m7pdek8&callback=JSON_CALLBACK&q=MOVIENAME


You have to send a JSONP request to this url with callback key as JSON_CALLBACK.
Study the JSON response.

You need to display the following information.

Total number of search results.
For every movie you need to display

[Image thumbnail] Name
				  Year of Release
				  Star cast
				  
				  
The UI is discussed in the class.
