create the following before you proceed reading.
stocks.html,stocks.js
******
1) You have a collection of stock symbols.
"MS", "GOOG", "INTC", "AAPL", "GM", "FB", "INFY", "HP"

2)You will send AJAX requests to the following url by passing each and every symbol.


http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20(%22SYMBOL%22)%0A%09%09&env=http%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltables.env&format=json

If you replace the SYMBOL with INFY or FB you will get a JSON output. Study the JSON output.
Look for

query.results.quote.LastTradePriceOnly (this will give the stock price)
query.results.quote.Change  (this will give the change w.r.t the previous value)

Display these values in the list. Use methods like add() in the Store class. You may not be able to use the proxy in the store.

If the Change is positive display the value in GREEN color and if the Change is negative display the value in RED color. Refer to Ext.XTemplate class in the documentation.

Have a button in the titlebar of the page called "Refresh". Clicking "Refresh" will refresh the new values.
